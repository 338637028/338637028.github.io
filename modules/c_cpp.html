        codecademy: Learn C++
      </h1>
      <p>
        Codecademy's <i>Learn C++</i> offers an introduction to an object-oriented, versatile programming language in the form of basic syntax and functions.
        The content of this module was very similar to that of codecademy's <a href="modules/c_js.html"><i>learn js</i></a> module/course, as both taught how to use an object-oriented general purpose programming language to a basic extent, introducing basics such as loops and objects.
        As this module contrasted the <i>learn js</i> module, I was able to accurately identify the many differences of the languages, and such a principal can be applied to other strands of education in which analysis and comparison are required.
        The most impactful part of this module was not any extrordinary functions of c++, but rather a limitation despite c++ generally being dubbed more useful than JavaScript: variables are not as flexible as in JS: whereas in C++ a variable can not change types (i.e. string to integer), a single JS variable can be nearly anything.
