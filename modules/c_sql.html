    <h1 class="underlined">codecademy: Learn SQL</h1>
    <p>
      This module gives an introduction to the data management programming
      language, SQL. Unlike previous courses taken at codecademy that were
      required for general use in all projects, sql differs greatly from other
      languages as it focuses on data and numbers rather than visuals and
      information consumed by humans. As this course was an introduction to the
      language, <i>Learn SQL</i> teaches basic syntax and functions of the
      language such as how to send and retrieve dpecific organized data. SQL is
      a language that interacts and organizes data, and thus the same principles
      of SQL can be applied while learning other data-heavy school subjects such
      as mathematicss, accounting or data science. The most impactful part of
      this module was the entirety of SQL itself, and how it's purpose and use
      greatly differ from other languages that I have previously used. No single
      function was significantly impactful as most functions that one would
      expect from a language that manages data were present, but the fact that
      SQL's use is so specific was interesting.
