    <h1 class="underlined">codecademy: Learn p5.js</h1>
    <p>
      Codecademy's <i>Learn p5.js</i> course offers a deeper dive into
      JavaScript through introducing the many strengths of the
      <i><a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a></i> library.
      Students are now able to explore p5.js' many visual elements and useful
      functions to create any range of simple interactive sketches imaginable.
      As this module strictly taught a very specific library that introduced
      elements exclusive to a single programming language, the possible
      application of the introduced concepts and elements are limited to only
      being useful to encourage the continuation of learning in niche subjects
      that focus on visual and audible elements, such as visual art. Since this
      module introduces a single library containing many elements I would
      describe the p5.js library in it's entirety as impactful, however of those
      many elements the most impactful were definitely the basic shape functions
      and the versatility of the canvas (i.e. compatibility with other HTML5
      elements, size flexibility).
