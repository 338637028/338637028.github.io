    <h1 class="underlined">Khan Academy Computer Programming Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h1>
    <p>
      Khan Academy's <i>Natural Simulations</i> pushed the p5.js library to it's
      limit as it simulates various physics-heavy procedures and introduces
      advanced programming concepts such as new forms of random, object-oriented
      object-oriented design and noise. This module was the first real challenge
      of the course thanks to the many new concepts introduced, and thanks to
      the time assigned (i.e. at the very start of the semester along with other
      more simple modules) it serves as an excellent baseline of expectations
      for the coming projects. This module focuses specifically on spcific JS
      features as opposed to broad concepts that would be appliccable to other
      strands of education, however one could use the physics features of the
      p5.js library covered in this module to better their understanding of
      physics principles. The most impactful part of this module was the
      introduction of particle systems, storing large quantities of objects in
      single variables. This concept proved useful in subsequent projects, as
      being able to create large quantities of simple objects allows for much
      more diverse and complex sketches.
