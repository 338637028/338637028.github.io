    <h1 class="underlined">codecademy: Learn JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      This module serves as an introduction to JavaScript, an object-oriented
      language commonly used in conjunction with HTML in webpages to perform
      anything from basic logic to complex, object-oriented interactive visuals.
      As this module was also an introduction level course on one of the many
      languages that would later be necessary for larger scale projects, this
      module taught many basic concepts that were absent in HTML, including
      logic, methematical operations and very basic object-oriented design. This
      module was one of the more applicable of the first few 'inroductory'
      modules (i.e.
      <a href="programming.html"><i>programming</i></a> and
      <a href="c_html.html"><i>learn HTML</i></a>
      ), as the concepts included in the course such as logic and functions are
      easily appliccable in other logic-based fields of education. Application
      in other strands of education I will be able to continue improving my
      proficiency and understanding of these concepts. Codecademy's
      <i>Learn JavaScript</i> introduces a large portion of concepts used in
      later projects in the ICS4U course, but the most notable and interesting
      of those concepts include objects and functions, two of the more complex
      yet widely applicable concepts.
