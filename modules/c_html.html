    <h1 class="underlined">codecademy: Learn HTML</h1>
    <p>
      Codecademy's <i>Learn HTML</i> course offers an introduction into HTML, a
      language used in nearly every front end element of the world wide web, in
      a very digestible, beginner-friendly course spanning multiple projects
      that each cover various aspects of the language. In the scope of the
      classroom this module served as a refresher to more experienced coders and
      an introduction to others, in preperation for future projects that require
      HTML as a foundation for object-oriented design. The course explores basic
      syntax of the language, tables, forms and semantic HTML. As this module
      focused on a specific programming language designed specifically for
      programmers to use it is difficult to relate the concepts taught in the
      module to other educational subjects, but it would be possible to apply my
      newfound knowledge of basic text structuring using multiple components
      into other forms of organized writing. The concept that had the most
      impact on my knowledge as a beginner programmer was semantic HTML, nothing
      more in the course provided as much depth and useful concepts as the
      semantic HTML section of the course.
