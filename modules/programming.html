      Khan Academy AP®︎/College Computer Science Principles: Programming
    </h1>

    <p>
      The Programming unit of Khan Academy's computer science principle course
      gives students a brief yet intricate preview of various basic algorithms,
      variables and other elements common in many real programming languages. In
      the scope of the semester, this module serves as an excellent introduction
      to computer science concepts to new programmers and an engaging refresher
      of previous years for experienced coders, as this is the first module of
      the course. Whereas the unit does not iterate on many new or unfamiliar
      concepts, it serves as a common starting ground for students of varying
      experience before the many projects and new computer science concepts that
      await them in the coming semester. As this module taught very fundamental
      and broad concepts of programming, it will be very easy to apply the
      concepts taught from the module in various other strands of education,
      including basic logic, conditionals and mathematical operators. The most
      significant parts of this module included the concept of procedures and
      the basics of logical equivalence.
