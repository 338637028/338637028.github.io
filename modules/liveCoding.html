    <h1 class="underlined" >Live Coding Challenge</h1>
    <p>
      The <i>Live Coding Challenge</i> tasked students to comprehend and
      refactor pre-made code as well as guide classmates through replicating the
      code. Accompanied was a live presentation and a live code-along. My group
      chose to learn and refactor Dan "codingtrain" Shiffman's coding challenge
      #149, Tic tac Toe. This module integrated all previous knowledge and
      experience from previous modules, while also requiring virtuosity in the
      understanding of the given coding challenge, in order to be able to teach
      others. Being a larger scale project the module introduced another broad
      and widely useful skill, that being extremely basic teaching. As I now
      have basic experience walking classmates through a basic procedure, I now
      feel confident in my ability to do the same in other strands of education,
      which will allow me to continue to cooperate with peers in learning and
      professional environments. The most impactful aspect of this module was
      the object-refactoring of the original code to create a new, creative
      version of the sketch by changing one or multiple aspects. I chose to
      create an easily multidimensional version of Tic Tac Toe comprised of
      cube-board objects, which I spent a large portion of work time on.
      Creating a fully functional and accurate three-dimensional version of Tic
      Tac Toe is perhaps my most complex and impressive coding project that I
      have completed.
